# ngi-projectportal-back-end
This is the repository that contains the back-end application code.

In this readme you can find general information about this project and also a quick start-up so you can run it locally on your own machine.

This project uses the Springboot framework in combination with the following dependencies:
* Spring Web
* Spring Data Neo4j

## Quickstart
This is a step-by-step procedure to run the back-end locally. Because this uses a Neo4j it's more difficult to set it up.

### Install and configure Neo4j
